👋 Hi there! I'm **Egypta Gogoi**

💻 Aspiring Software Engineer | Backend-Focused Developer

🎓 MCA'25 @ Tezpur University  
🌍 Currently interning at a FinTech startup (Fisdom) where I'm enhancing backend systems with Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and GCP.

🚀 What I'm up to:
- Learning Java and diving deeper into full-stack development  
- Documenting my coding journey, one step at a time  
- Building real-world projects in Python, JavaScript, Django, React, and more

🧠 Slow but steady learner – I believe in deeply understanding concepts over rushing through them.

🔧 **Tech Stack**:  
Python | Java | JavaScript | Flask | Django | React.js | PostgreSQL | Docker | GCP | Git
